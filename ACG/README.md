# ACG -Advanced Computer Graphics

### house.html
The first home work. just draw a house with huml and javascript. 

### shader1.html
The first time for creating shaders.
Make a shader where the image intensity decreases exponentially from the center.

### shader2.html
Draw a box in the center of the canvas using a fragment shader.

### shader3.html
Create the letter A using Signed Distance Functions.

### ramiel.html
Create 'Neon Genesis Evangelion’s Ramiel'. The first time for creating 3DCD model.

* What I should create.
    * A floor which can be grey or brown.
    * An octohedron (Ramiel) that should be blue.
    * Background should be white or light blue that is not confused with Ramiel

* The scine should ...
    * Be defined using polygon meshes
    * The meshes should be gl.TRIANGLE_STRIP
    * Use transformations to position Ramiel
    * Instead of lighting, define colour based on depth (z coordinate relative to camera, with darker colours the further away)
    * Make the octohedron spin around slowly
    * Use a perspective camera
    * Make sure Ramiel is completely inside the rendered scene

### shading.html
Shade the simple scene with three types of illumination: ambient, directional, and point light.
